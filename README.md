This repo contains a minimal code-implementation for the paper DEEP NORMED EMBEDDINGS FOR PATIENT REPRESENTATION.

The file trip.py contains the code for the loss function, pytorch dataset class, and training loops of the representation learning.

The Dataset class assumes the data resides in a Pandas DataFrame with appropriate labels, however it should be straightforward to adapt to other forms.
